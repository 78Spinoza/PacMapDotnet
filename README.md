**Technology invented 2021 available as production ready code!**

## 🎉 **Project Status: Testing Phase**

This is a **high-performance** implementation of **PaCMAP** (Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation and Projection) in native C++ with C#/.NET bindings, designed for **production use cases**. It includes features like model save/load, faster approximate fitting using **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)** for efficient nearest neighbor search, advanced quantization, and optimizations for **large datasets**.

**⚠️ Testing Phase Notice**: We are currently in testing phase. Only Euclidean distance is fully verified and working. Additional distance metrics and advanced features are under development.



## Project Motivation

There were no C++/C# implementations of this technology invented in 2021 (as of 2025-10-12).
The only existing implementations were in Python and Rust.

Current PaCMAP implementations are mostly Python-based scientific tools lacking:
- **Deterministic projection and fit using a fixed random seed**
- **Save/load functionality** for trained models
- **Fast approximate fitting** (e.g., via HNSW) for large-scale production
- **Cross-platform portability** to .NET and native C++
- **Safety features** like outlier detection and progress reporting
- **Support for arbitrary embedding dimensions** and multiple metrics
- **Linux/Windows binaries for easy testing and cloud deployment**

This C++/C# version bridges these gaps, making PaCMAP **production-ready** for AI pipelines. See also my previous UMAP (invented 2018) implementation that is the scientific predecessor of the improved PaCMAP.

## What is Dimensionality Reduction (DR)?

**Dimensionality Reduction (DR)** is a technique used to reduce the number of variables or features in high-dimensional data while preserving as much critical information as possible. It transforms data from a high-dimensional space (e.g., thousands of features) into a lower-dimensional space (e.g., 2D or 3D) for easier **analysis**, **visualization**, and **processing**. Ideally, DR discovers linear and non-linear dependencies and unnecessary dimensions, reducing the data to a more informative dimensionality. DR is used to understand the underlying structure of the data.

### Why DR is Crucial for Data Filtering and AI
- **Combats the Curse of Dimensionality**: High dimensions lead to sparse data, increased computational costs, and overfitting in machine learning models.
- **Reveals Hidden Patterns**: Enables effective data exploration by uncovering clusters, outliers, and structures in complex datasets.
- **Enhances AI Pipelines**: Serves as a preprocessing step to improve model efficiency, reduce noise, and boost performance in tasks like classification, clustering, and anomaly detection.
- **Facilitates Visualization**: Creates human-interpretable 2D/3D representations, aiding decision-making for data filtering and AI model validation.

## Evolution of Dimensionality Reduction Methods

Dimensionality reduction has evolved from basic linear methods to advanced non-linear techniques that capture complex data structures:

- **Before 2002**: The go-to method was **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, introduced by Karl Pearson in 1901 and formalized in the 1930s. PCA projects data onto linear components that maximize variance but struggles with non-linear manifolds in datasets like images or genomics.

- **2002**: **Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE)** was invented by **Geoffrey Hinton** (an AI pioneer) and **Sam Roweis**. SNE used a probabilistic approach to preserve local similarities via pairwise distances, marking a leap into non-linear DR. However, it faced issues like the "crowding problem" and optimization challenges.

- **2008**: **t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**, developed by **Laurens van der Maaten** and **Geoffrey Hinton**, improved on SNE. It used t-distributions in the low-dimensional space to address crowding and enhance cluster separation. While excellent for visualization, t-SNE is computationally heavy and weak at preserving global structures.

- **2018**: **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**, created by **Leland McInnes**, **John Healy**, and **James Melville**, advanced the field with fuzzy simplicial sets and a loss function balancing local and global structures. UMAP is faster and more scalable than t-SNE but remains "near-sighted," prioritizing local details.

- **2020**: **PaCMAP** was introduced in the paper *"Understanding How Dimension Reduction Tools Work: An Empirical Approach to Deciphering t-SNE, UMAP, TriMap, and PaCMAP for Data Visualization"* by **Yingfan Wang**, **Haiyang Huang**, **Cynthia Rudin**, and **Yaron Shaposhnik**. First submitted on **arXiv on December 8, 2020** and published in the **Journal of Machine Learning Research** in 2021. PaCMAP's **unique loss function** optimizes for preserving **both local and global structures**, using pairwise controls to balance neighborhood relationships and inter-cluster distances, making it highly effective for diverse datasets.

### The Evolution of Dimensionality Reduction (2008-2021) and What We Have Now

The journey from early methods to PaCMAP reveals fundamental challenges in dimensionality reduction that plagued researchers for over a decade.

#### The Hyperparameter Nightmare

Early methods like t-SNE suffered from **hyperparameter sensitivity** - small changes in parameters could dramatically alter results, making reproducible science difficult. The image below demonstrates this critical problem:

![Hyperparameters Matter](docs/Other/HyperparamsMatter.PNG)

**The Problem**: Depending on arbitrary hyperparameter choices, you get completely different results. While we know the ground truth in this synthetic example, **most real-world high-dimensional data lacks known ground truth**, making parameter selection a guessing game that undermines scientific reproducibility.

#### The Cluster Size Illusion

Even more problematic, t-SNE's cluster sizes are **meaningless artifacts** of the algorithm, not representations of actual data density or importance:

![t-SNE Cluster Size Issues](docs/Other/ClusterSizetSNEMeansnothing.PNG)

**Critical Insight**: In t-SNE visualizations, **larger clusters don't mean more data points or higher importance**. This fundamental flaw has misled countless analyses in genomics, machine learning, and data science where cluster size interpretation was assumed to be meaningful.

#### The MNIST Reality Check

The difference becomes stark when comparing methods on the well-understood MNIST dataset:

![MNIST t-SNE Comparison](docs/Other/MNISTtsne.png)

Notice how t-SNE creates misleading cluster size variations that don't reflect the actual balanced nature of MNIST digit classes. **This is why PaCMAP was revolutionary** - it preserves both local neighborhoods AND global structure without these artifacts.

### **Key Quantitative Results from the PaCMAP Paper**
> - **🌐 Superior Global Structure Preservation**: **PaCMAP performs comparably to TriMap**, excelling at maintaining inter-cluster distances and global relationships, unlike the "near-sighted" t-SNE and UMAP.
> - **🔍 Excellent Local Structure Preservation**: **PaCMAP matches the performance of UMAP and t-SNE**, ensuring tight neighborhood structures are preserved for detailed local analysis.
> - **⚡ Significantly Faster Computation**: **PaCMAP is much faster** than t-SNE, UMAP, and TriMap, leveraging efficient optimizations like HNSW for rapid processing.

**t-SNE and UMAP** are often "near-sighted," prioritizing local neighborhoods at the expense of global structures. PaCMAP's balanced approach makes it a standout choice.

The critical insight is that these techniques need **production-ready implementations** to shine in real-world AI pipelines—this project delivers exactly that.

## PaCMAP Advantages

PaCMAP excels due to its balanced and efficient approach:
- **Unique Loss Function**: **Optimizes for both local and global structure preservation**, using pairwise controls to maintain neighborhood relationships and inter-cluster distances, unlike the local bias of t-SNE and UMAP.
- **Reduced Parameter Sensitivity**: **Less sensitive to hyperparameter choices** than t-SNE and UMAP, producing stable, high-quality embeddings with minimal tuning, making it more robust across diverse datasets.
- **Diversity**: Captures regimes and transitions that UMAP might miss, enhancing ensemble diversity when errors are uncorrelated.
- **Global Faithfulness**: Preserves relative distances between clusters better, ideal for identifying smooth risk/return continua, not just tight clusters.
- **Efficiency**: **Significantly lower computation time** than t-SNE, UMAP, and TriMap, especially with HNSW approximations.
- **Versatility**: Perfect for visualization, feature extraction, and preprocessing in AI workflows.

# The Mammoth Test: Ultimate Challenge for Dimensionality Reduction

Projecting complex 3D structures like a mammoth into 2D space while preserving **all anatomical details** represents one of the most challenging tests for dimensionality reduction algorithms. The algorithm must manage intricate non-linearities with minimal guidance - essentially just one hyperparameter.

## The Original Challenge

*Another complex 3D structure showcasing the challenges of dimensionality reduction*

## Cognitive Parallel: How Our Brain Works

Interestingly, the human brain faces a similar challenge. **Our minds project all memories into a high-dimensional manifold space**, and during sleep, we navigate point-by-point through this space to "defragment" and consolidate memories. PaCMAP's approach mirrors this biological process of maintaining structural relationships while reducing dimensionality.

## PaCMAP's Remarkable Results

## Excellence Across Domains

### High-Dimensional Data: MNIST Classification

PaCMAP excels with high-dimensional data. Here's the MNIST dataset projection where each color represents digits 0-9:

![PaCMAP Results](docs/Other/PACMAP%20and%20MNIST.PNG)
*MNIST digits (0-9) projected to 2D space - notice the clear separation and meaningful clustering without size artifacts*

**Key Achievement**: Unlike t-SNE, the cluster sizes here actually reflect the balanced nature of MNIST classes, and the spatial relationships between digits (e.g., 6 and 9 being close) make intuitive sense.

### Topological Challenges: The S-Curve with Hole

Even "impossible" topological structures like an S-curve with a hole are perfectly preserved by PaCMAP:

![S-Curve with PaCMAP](docs/Other/SCurveWithPACMAN.PNG)
*S-curve with hole - a challenging topological structure maintained perfectly in 2D projection*

**Why This Matters**: Real-world data often contains complex topological features (holes, curves, manifolds). PaCMAP's ability to preserve these structures makes it invaluable for scientific data analysis, genomics, and complex system modeling.
