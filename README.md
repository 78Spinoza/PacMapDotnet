**Technology invented 2021 available as production ready code!**

## üéâ **Project Status: Working Solution Awaiting Optimization and Validation**

This is a **high-performance** implementation of **PaCMAP** (Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation and Projection) in native C++ with C#/.NET bindings, designed for **production use cases**. It includes features like model save/load, faster approximate fitting using **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)** for efficient nearest neighbor search, advanced quantization, and optimizations for **large datasets**.

**‚úÖ Working Solution**: We have a complete, functional implementation with Euclidean distance fully working. The solution includes comprehensive demo applications, parameter exploration with animations, and all core features implemented. Currently undergoing final optimization and validation testing before full production release.


---

**My perspective on this is:**

**PaCMAP** (introduced in 2021) represents a methodological advancement over **UMAP** (2018). One of the enduring challenges in machine learning is **hyperparameter tuning**, as model performance often depends critically on parameter configurations that are non-trivial to determine. While experts with a deep understanding of both the mathematical foundations and data characteristics can address this effectively, the process remains complex, time-consuming, and prone to error.

In the context of **dimensionality reduction (DR)**, this issue creates a **classic chicken-and-egg problem**: DR is typically used to explore and structure data, yet the quality of the DR itself depends on carefully chosen hyperparameters. This interdependence can lead to **systematic biases** and **overconfidence** in the resulting low-dimensional embeddings.

**‚ÄúThere can be only one!‚Äù** (a nod to the *Highlander* movie). Although PaCMAP does involve hyperparameters, they are **not highly sensitive**, and the effective tuning space is **reduced to a single key parameter**: the number of neighbors. This property substantially simplifies model configuration and enhances robustness across diverse datasets.

Furthermore, most DR methods preceding PaCMAP relied on **PCA-based initialization**. Because PCA is inherently **linear** and fails to capture **non-linear** structures effectively, this introduces significant limitations. PaCMAP, in contrast, employs **random initialization**, removing the dependency on PCA and mitigating potential **initialization bias** in the embedding process.

## Project Motivation

There were no C++/C# implementations of this technology invented in 2021 (as of 2025-10-12).
The only existing implementations were in Python and Rust.

Current PaCMAP implementations are mostly Python-based scientific tools lacking:
- **Deterministic projection and fit using a fixed random seed**
- **Save/load functionality** for trained models
- **Fast approximate fitting** (e.g., via HNSW) for large-scale production
- **Cross-platform portability** to .NET and native C++
- **Safety features** like outlier detection and progress reporting
- **Support for arbitrary embedding dimensions** and multiple metrics
- **Linux/Windows binaries for easy testing and cloud deployment**

This C++/C# version bridges these gaps, making PaCMAP **production-ready** for AI pipelines. See also my previous [UMAP (invented 2018) implementation](https://github.com/78Spinoza/UMAP) that is the scientific predecessor of the improved PaCMAP.

## What is Dimensionality Reduction (DR)?

**Dimensionality Reduction (DR)** is a technique used to reduce the number of variables or features in high-dimensional data while preserving as much critical information as possible. It transforms data from a high-dimensional space (e.g., thousands of features) into a lower-dimensional space (e.g., 2D or 3D) for easier **analysis**, **visualization**, and **processing**. Ideally, DR discovers linear and non-linear dependencies and unnecessary dimensions, reducing the data to a more informative dimensionality. DR is used to understand the underlying structure of the data.

### Why DR is Crucial for Data Filtering and AI
- **Combats the Curse of Dimensionality**: High dimensions lead to sparse data, increased computational costs, and overfitting in machine learning models.
- **Reveals Hidden Patterns**: Enables effective data exploration by uncovering clusters, outliers, and structures in complex datasets.
- **Enhances AI Pipelines**: Serves as a preprocessing step to improve model efficiency, reduce noise, and boost performance in tasks like classification, clustering, and anomaly detection.
- **Facilitates Visualization**: Creates human-interpretable 2D/3D representations, aiding decision-making for data filtering and AI model validation.

## Evolution of Dimensionality Reduction Methods

Dimensionality reduction has evolved from basic linear methods to advanced non-linear techniques that capture complex data structures:

- **Before 2002**: The go-to method was **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, introduced by Karl Pearson in 1901 and formalized in the 1930s. PCA projects data onto linear components that maximize variance but struggles with non-linear manifolds in datasets like images or genomics.

- **2002**: **Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE)** was invented by **Geoffrey Hinton** (an AI pioneer) and **Sam Roweis**. SNE used a probabilistic approach to preserve local similarities via pairwise distances, marking a leap into non-linear DR. However, it faced issues like the "crowding problem" and optimization challenges.

- **2008**: **t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**, developed by **Laurens van der Maaten** and **Geoffrey Hinton**, improved on SNE. It used t-distributions in the low-dimensional space to address crowding and enhance cluster separation. While excellent for visualization, t-SNE is computationally heavy and weak at preserving global structures.

- **2018**: **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**, created by **Leland McInnes**, **John Healy**, and **James Melville**, advanced the field with fuzzy simplicial sets and a loss function balancing local and global structures. UMAP is faster and more scalable than t-SNE but remains "near-sighted," prioritizing local details.

- **2020**: **PaCMAP** was introduced in the paper *"Understanding How Dimension Reduction Tools Work: An Empirical Approach to Deciphering t-SNE, UMAP, TriMap, and PaCMAP for Data Visualization"* by **Yingfan Wang**, **Haiyang Huang**, **Cynthia Rudin**, and **Yaron Shaposhnik**. First submitted on **arXiv on December 8, 2020** and published in the **Journal of Machine Learning Research** in 2021. PaCMAP's **unique loss function** optimizes for preserving **both local and global structures**, using pairwise controls to balance neighborhood relationships and inter-cluster distances, making it highly effective for diverse datasets.

### The Evolution of Dimensionality Reduction (2008-2021) and What We Have Now

The journey from early methods to PaCMAP reveals fundamental challenges in dimensionality reduction that plagued researchers for over a decade.

#### The Hyperparameter Nightmare

Early methods like t-SNE suffered from **hyperparameter sensitivity** - small changes in parameters could dramatically alter results, making reproducible science difficult. The image below demonstrates this critical problem:

![Hyperparameters Matter](docs/Other/HyperparamsMatter.PNG)

**The Problem**: Depending on arbitrary hyperparameter choices, you get completely different results. While we know the ground truth in this synthetic example, **most real-world high-dimensional data lacks known ground truth**, making parameter selection a guessing game that undermines scientific reproducibility.

#### The Cluster Size Illusion

Even more problematic, t-SNE's cluster sizes are **meaningless artifacts** of the algorithm, not representations of actual data density or importance:

![t-SNE Cluster Size Issues](docs/Other/ClusterSizetSNEMeansnothing.PNG)

**Critical Insight**: In t-SNE visualizations, **larger clusters don't mean more data points or higher importance**. This fundamental flaw has misled countless analyses in genomics, machine learning, and data science where cluster size interpretation was assumed to be meaningful.

#### The MNIST Reality Check

The difference becomes stark when comparing methods on the well-understood MNIST dataset:

![MNIST t-SNE Comparison](docs/Other/MNISTtsne.png)

Notice how t-SNE creates misleading cluster size variations that don't reflect the actual balanced nature of MNIST digit classes. **This is why PaCMAP was revolutionary** - it preserves both local neighborhoods AND global structure without these artifacts.


Even UMAP, a later version, is very **sensitive** to hyperparameters as you can see below:

# Results from our current library

### **Key Quantitative Results from the PaCMAP Paper**
> - **üåê Superior Global Structure Preservation**: **PaCMAP performs comparably to TriMap**, excelling at maintaining inter-cluster distances and global relationships, unlike the "near-sighted" t-SNE and UMAP.
> - **üîç Excellent Local Structure Preservation**: **PaCMAP matches the performance of UMAP and t-SNE**, ensuring tight neighborhood structures are preserved for detailed local analysis.
> - **‚ö° Significantly Faster Computation**: **PaCMAP is much faster** than t-SNE, UMAP, and TriMap, leveraging efficient optimizations like HNSW for rapid processing.

**t-SNE and UMAP** are often "near-sighted," prioritizing local neighborhoods at the expense of global structures. PaCMAP's balanced approach makes it a standout choice.

The critical insight is that these techniques need **production-ready implementations** to shine in real-world AI pipelines‚Äîthis project delivers exactly that.

## PaCMAP Advantages

PaCMAP excels due to its balanced and efficient approach:
- **Unique Loss Function**: **Optimizes for both local and global structure preservation**, using pairwise controls to maintain neighborhood relationships and inter-cluster distances, unlike the local bias of t-SNE and UMAP.
- **Reduced Parameter Sensitivity**: **Less sensitive to hyperparameter choices** than t-SNE and UMAP, producing stable, high-quality embeddings with minimal tuning, making it more robust across diverse datasets.
- **Diversity**: Captures regimes and transitions that UMAP might miss, enhancing ensemble diversity when errors are uncorrelated.
- **Global Faithfulness**: Preserves relative distances between clusters better, ideal for identifying smooth risk/return continua, not just tight clusters.
- **Efficiency**: **Significantly lower computation time** than t-SNE, UMAP, and TriMap, especially with HNSW approximations.
- **Versatility**: Perfect for visualization, feature extraction, and preprocessing in AI workflows.

# The Mammoth Test: Ultimate Challenge for Dimensionality Reduction

Projecting complex 3D structures like a mammoth into 2D space while preserving **all anatomical details** represents one of the most challenging tests for dimensionality reduction algorithms. The algorithm must manage intricate non-linearities with minimal guidance - essentially just one hyperparameter.

## Cognitive Parallel: How Our Brain Works

Interestingly, the human brain faces a similar challenge. **Our minds project all memories into a high-dimensional manifold space**, and during sleep, we navigate point-by-point through this space to "defragment" and consolidate memories. PaCMAP's approach mirrors this biological process of maintaining structural relationships while reducing dimensionality.

## PaCMAP's Remarkable Results

## Excellence Across Domains

### High-Dimensional Data: MNIST Classification

PaCMAP excels with high-dimensional data. Here's the MNIST dataset projection where each color represents digits 0-9:

![PaCMAP Results](docs/Other/PACMAP%20and%20MNIST.PNG)
*MNIST digits (0-9) projected to 2D space - notice the clear separation and meaningful clustering without size artifacts*

**Key Achievement**: Unlike t-SNE, the cluster sizes here actually reflect the balanced nature of MNIST classes, and the spatial relationships between digits (e.g., 6 and 9 being close) make intuitive sense.

### Topological Challenges: The S-Curve with Hole

Even "impossible" topological structures like an S-curve with a hole are perfectly preserved by PaCMAP:

![S-Curve with PaCMAP](docs/Other/SCurveWithPACMAN.PNG)
*S-curve with hole - a challenging topological structure maintained perfectly in 2D projection*

**Why This Matters**: Real-world data often contains complex topological features (holes, curves, manifolds). PaCMAP's ability to preserve these structures makes it invaluable for scientific data analysis, genomics, and complex system modeling.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/78Spinoza/PacMapDotnet.git
cd PacMapDotnet

# If you already cloned without --recurse-submodules, initialize submodules:
# git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build C# solution

dotnet run
```

**‚úÖ Pre-built binaries included** - No C++ compilation required! The native PACMAP libraries for both Windows (`pacmap.dll`) and Linux (`libpacmap.so`) are included in this repository.

**üì¶ Eigen Library**: This project uses Eigen 3.4.0 (header-only) as a git submodule for SIMD optimizations. The submodule is automatically downloaded when you clone with `--recurse-submodules`. If building from source, Eigen headers are required.

## üéõ Hyperparameters

PaCMAP uses three main hyperparameters that control the balance between local and global structure preservation:

### `n_neighbors` (Number of Neighbors)
**Default: 10**
The number of neighbors considered in the k-Nearest Neighbor graph. For optimal results, we recommend the adaptive formula:

**For datasets with `n` samples:**
- **Small datasets (n < 10,000)**: Use `n_neighbors = 10`
- **Large datasets (n ‚â• 10,000)**: Use `n_neighbors = 10 + 15 * (log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(n) - 4)`

**This adaptive formula is a very good rule of thumb** for optimizing PaCMAP performance across different dataset sizes. It automatically scales the neighborhood size to maintain the proper balance between local and global structure preservation as your dataset grows.

**Examples:**
- 1,000 samples ‚Üí 10 neighbors
- 10,000 samples ‚Üí 10 neighbors
- 100,000 samples ‚Üí 25 neighbors
- 1,000,000 samples ‚Üí 40 neighbors

‚ö†Ô∏è **Parameter Warning**: The C++ implementation will validate this parameter and issue warnings when inappropriate values are used.

### `MN_ratio` (Mid-Near Pairs Ratio)
**Default: 0.5**
Controls the ratio of mid-near pairs to number of neighbors:
`n_MN = ‚åän_neighbors √ó MN_ratio‚åã`

**Default recommendation**: 0.5 provides balanced local/global structure preservation.

### `FP_ratio` (Further Pairs Ratio)
**Default: 2.0**
Controls the ratio of further pairs to number of neighbors:
`n_FP = ‚åän_neighbors √ó FP_ratio‚åã`

**Default recommendation**: 2.0 maintains good global structure connectivity.

**Rule of Thumb**: For optimal results, maintain the relationship `FP_ratio = 4 √ó MN_ratio`. The C++ implementation will validate this relationship and issue warnings when incorrect parameters are used.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Parameter Validation**: The C++ implementation automatically validates all parameters (n_neighbors, MN_ratio, FP_ratio) and provides helpful warnings when they deviate from recommended ranges or relationships.

2. **For small datasets** (<1000 samples): Keep n_neighbors=10
3. **For large datasets**: Use the adaptive formula above
4. **MN_ratio**: Increase to 0.7-1.0 for more global structure
5. **FP_ratio**: Adjust 1.5-3.0 for different global preservation levels

The implementation includes automatic parameter validation and will provide helpful warnings when parameters are outside recommended ranges.

    progressCallback: (phase, current, total, percent, message) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[{phase}] {percent:F1}% - {message}");
    }
);

// embedding is now a float[samples, 2] array
Console.WriteLine($"Embedding shape: [{embedding.GetLength(0)}, {embedding.GetLength(1)}]");

// Save model for later use

    learningRate: 1.0f,
    initializationStdDev: 1e-4f  // Smaller initialization for better convergence
);
