# PaCMAP Enhanced - Ongoing Development Project

⚠️ **PROJECT STATUS: IN DEVELOPMENT - KNOWN ISSUES** ⚠️

This is an **ongoing development project** implementing **PaCMAP** (Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation and Projection) in Rust with C#/.NET bindings. While the core architecture is in place, there are currently **active issues** being resolved.

## 🚧 Current Issues Being Fixed

### Critical Issues
1. **Rust FFI Hanging Bug** 🔴
   - The Rust FFI implementation hangs consistently at 20% (normalization phase)
   - Affects all datasets regardless of size
   - Currently investigating the normalization code in the Rust implementation

2. **MNIST NPY Loading** 🟡
   - NumSharp compatibility issues prevent loading real MNIST `.npy` files
   - Need to implement proper NumPy file parsing or alternative loading method

### Working Components ✅
- **Real Data Loading**: Mammoth CSV data loads correctly (8000 3D points)
- **C# Demo Framework**: Complete demo application with progress reporting
- **Visualization**: ScottPlot integration working for both MNIST and mammoth data
- **Project Structure**: Clean, organized codebase with proper separation of concerns

## What Works vs What Doesn't

### ✅ Working Features
- **Data Loading**: Real mammoth CSV data (8000 points with proper coordinate ranges)
- **C# Demo Application**: Complete with progress reporting and visualization
- **Visualization Pipeline**: ScottPlot integration creates proper charts
- **Project Organization**: Clean structure with proper data flow

### ❌ Current Issues
- **Rust FFI**: Hangs during normalization phase (20% progress)
- **MNIST Loading**: Cannot load real MNIST NPY files due to NumSharp issues
- **Progress Stall**: Real PacMAP algorithm cannot complete due to Rust hang

## Previous Discoveries

During development, we discovered and fixed:
1. **Synthetic Data Issue**: Original demo was generating fake data instead of loading real files ✅ FIXED
2. **Random Points Problem**: Visualizations showed random scatter instead of meaningful patterns ✅ FIXED
3. **Data Path Issues**: Proper loading of real mammoth coordinate data ✅ FIXED

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Debug Rust FFI Hang**: Investigate normalization code in `pacmap-enhanced/src/`
2. **Fix MNIST Loading**: Implement proper NPY file parsing or alternative format
3. **Progress Reporting**: Ensure the Rust FFI progress callbacks work correctly

### Development Approach
- Focus on getting the Rust FFI working with small datasets first
- Implement timeout/error handling for FFI calls
- Add comprehensive logging to identify exactly where the hang occurs

## Technical Details

### Rust Implementation Status
- **Location**: `pacmap-enhanced/` directory
- **Issue**: Hangs consistently at normalization phase (20% progress)
- **Affected**: All data types and sizes
- **DLL Present**: `pacmap_enhanced.dll` builds successfully

### C# Demo Status
- **Location**: `PacMapDemo/` directory
- **Framework**: .NET 8.0
- **Dependencies**: ScottPlot, NumSharp (problematic), Microsoft.Data.Analysis
- **Status**: Core framework working, blocked by Rust FFI

## Contributing

This is an active development project. Current focus areas:
1. Rust FFI debugging and normalization code review
2. NumSharp alternative implementation for NPY file loading
3. Error handling and timeout mechanisms

**Note**: This README reflects the current development state. The project has a solid foundation but requires resolution of the critical FFI hanging issue before being production-ready.
